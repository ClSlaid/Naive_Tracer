# Naive_Tracer
## what is it?
It is a simple implement of [`Ray Tracing in One Weekend`](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Which is completely in **`Rust`**.🦀️
## how to run?
It's sorry that this repository is still under development, however you can still try it out by:
```bash
# cd to repo dir
touch output.ppm    # create an PPM file for output
cargo run --release > output.ppm    # run the project and redirect output to output.ppm
```
## why build it?
- for fun
- get ticket to [`Brupst`](https://github.com/brupst)
- inspired by `@Hyiker` 🐔️ from `BUPT SCS`
